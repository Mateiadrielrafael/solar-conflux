# Clever-dots---gennetic-algorithm-in-js
I first watched Coding Bullet's tutorial, and it was AWESOME. Then i tried this like every day. This is my first succesfully attemp, and my 4th attemp overall. 

How-it-works:
Basically its just a simple genetic algorithm using tools as selection , cross over and mutation
You must wait a loooooooong time for it to train, so dont tell me that it doesnt work, until you dont actually see. 
To know its progress, wait until you got 20 "thinking" mesages in the console.
I might add a progress bar another time



Note: 
I sctually understood how it works from a flappy bird AI project on Github, so you would probably see some similarities
