# Option

## Installation

```sh
npm install @adrielus/option
```

(There is also an amd build at `/dist/bundle.amd.js` which uses the `Option` namespace)

## Usage

Curently there are no docs, but all functions have the same type definition as the ones from [fsharp](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualfsharpdocs/conceptual/core.option-module-%5Bfsharp%5D) (except the ones from my package are not curreied)
