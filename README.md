# The _solar conflux_

This repository contains numerous experiments of mine which do not deserve their own repositories. It exists for archival purposes.

The repositories are properly imported using [./import.sh](./import.sh) â€” a dangerous script that shouldn't be run unless everything in the local repo has been backed up.

## Navigation

The experiments are currently organized based on the language they use:

- [Elm](./elm/)
- [F#](./fsharp/)
- [Idris](./idris/)
- [Javascript](./javascript/)
- [Lean](./lean/)
- [Lua](./lua/)
- [Purescript](./purescript/)
- [Python](./python/)
- [Typescript](./typescript/)
- [Typst](./typst/)
